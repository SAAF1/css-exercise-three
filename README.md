# css-exercise-three

This CSS exercise focused on box model and I:

1) Started using atom live-server.

2) Organized the code (nesting etc.).

3) Wrangled code into displaying a final result that exactly mimicked a photo I was given.

Here's what it looked like at the end:


<img style="max-width:400px;" alt="screenshot of hover state" src=images/hover_state.png>

The photo is taken while one of the boxes are in a hover state.
